# Round 1 — Problem Statement

## The Task

Build a complete, real-world OpenEnv environment that an AI agent can learn from through the standard `step() / reset() / state()` API.

### Key Requirements at a Glance

*   Must simulate a real-world task (not games or toys)
*   Implement full OpenEnv spec: typed models, `step()/reset()/state()`, `openenv.yaml`
*   Minimum 3 tasks with agent graders (easy → medium → hard, scores 0.0–1.0)
*   Meaningful reward function with partial progress signals
*   Baseline inference script with reproducible scores
*   Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces + working Dockerfile
*   README with environment description, action/observation spaces, setup instructions

---

## Functional Requirements

### Real-world task simulation
The environment must simulate a task humans actually do. Not games, not toys. Examples: email triage, code review, data cleaning, scheduling, customer support, content moderation.

### OpenEnv spec compliance
Implement the full OpenEnv interface: typed Observation, Action, and Reward Pydantic models. `step(action)` → returns observation, reward, done, info. `reset()` → returns initial observation. `state()` → returns current state. `openenv.yaml` with metadata. Tested via `openenv validate`.

### Minimum 3 tasks with agent graders
Each task defines a concrete objective an agent must accomplish, with a programmatic grader that scores performance (0.0–1.0). Tasks should range: easy → medium → hard. Graders must have clear, deterministic success/failure criteria.

### Meaningful reward function
Provides signal over the full trajectory (not just binary end-of-episode). Rewards partial progress toward task completion. Penalizes clearly undesirable behavior (e.g. infinite loops, destructive actions).

### Baseline inference script
Uses the OpenAI API client to run a model against the environment. Reads API credentials from environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`). Produces a reproducible baseline score on all 3 tasks.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Deploys to a Hugging Face Space
Environment must run as a containerized HF Space tagged with `openenv`.

### Containerized execution
Must include a working `Dockerfile`. The environment should start cleanly with `docker build` + `docker run`.

### Documentation
README must include: environment description and motivation, action and observation space definitions, task descriptions with expected difficulty, setup and usage instructions, baseline scores.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Parameter                     | Weight | Description                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Real-world utility**        | 30%    | Does the environment model a genuine task? Would someone actually use this to train or evaluate agents? |
| **Task & grader quality**     | 25%    | Are tasks well-defined? Do graders accurately measure success? Meaningful difficulty progression?         |
| **Environment design**        | 20%    | Clean state management, sensible action/observation spaces, good reward shaping, proper episode boundaries. |
| **Code quality & spec compliance** | 15%    | Follows OpenEnv spec, clean project structure, typed models, documented, tested, Dockerfile works.      |
| **Creativity & novelty**      | 10%    | Novel problem domain, interesting mechanics, clever reward design, original approach.                 |

### Scoring Breakdown

#### Real-world utility (30%)
*   0–5: Toy/artificial problem with no practical application
*   6–15: Valid domain but shallow modeling of the real task
*   16–25: Good domain modeling, would be useful for agent evaluation
*   26–30: Excellent — fills a real gap, immediate value for the RL/agent community

#### Task & grader quality (25%)
*   3+ tasks with difficulty range?
*   Graders produce scores between 0.0–1.0?
*   Graders deterministic and reproducible?
*   Hard task genuinely challenges frontier models?

#### Environment design (20%)
*   `reset()` produces clean state?
*   Action/observation types well-designed and documented?
*   Reward function provides useful varying signal (not just sparse)?
*   Episode boundaries sensible?

#### Code quality & spec compliance (15%)
*   `openenv validate` passes?
*   `docker build && docker run` works?
*   HF Space deploys and responds?
*   Baseline script runs and reproduces scores?

#### Creativity & novelty (10%)
*   Domain we haven’t seen in OpenEnv before?
*   Reward design has interesting properties?
*   Clever mechanics that make the environment engaging?

## How Judging Works

### Phase 1: Automated Validation
Pass/fail gate — HF Space deploys, OpenEnv spec compliance, Dockerfile builds, baseline reproduces, 3+ tasks with graders.

### Phase 2: Agentic Evaluation
Scored — baseline agent re-run, standard Open LLM agent (e.g. Nemotron 3 Super) run against all environments, score variance check.

### Phase 3: Human Review
Top submissions reviewed by Meta and Hugging Face engineers for real-world utility, creativity, and exploit checks.

## Disqualification Criteria
*   Environment does not deploy or respond
*   Plagiarized or trivially modified existing environments
*   Graders that always return the same score
*   No baseline inference script

---

## Pre-Submission Checklist
All must pass or you're disqualified:
1.  **HF Space deploys**: Automated ping to the Space URL — must return 200 and respond to `reset()`
2.  **OpenEnv spec compliance**: Validate `openenv.yaml`, typed models, `step()/reset()/state()` endpoints
3.  **Dockerfile builds**: Automated `docker build` on the submitted repo
4.  **Baseline reproduces**: Run the submitted inference script — must complete without error and produce scores
5.  **3+ tasks with graders**: Enumerate tasks, run each grader, verify scores in 0.0–1.0 range

---

## Additional Endpoints to Expose
*   `/baseline`: Trigger inference script and returns baseline score for all 3 tasks
*   `/grader`: Returns grader score after an episode is completed
*   `/tasks`: Returns list of tasks and the action schema (fields required for an action in a step)
